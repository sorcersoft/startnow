The events package provides a mechanism for a large number of events
to flow from a server to a client without the use of callbacks or
other mechanims which might be difficult because of server firewalling.
<p>
The intended use for this infrastructure is that an application is 
generating a large number of events that are topic based (or could be 
topic based).  The intent is that the application will create an
instance of the EventManager class (or another implementation of
IEventManager).  It will then make this IEventManager visible to
other users via Jini LUS registration.  
<p>
Clients will find and use an implementation of IEventManager,
and register for events.  The server application will pump out
events by calling EventManager.deliverEvent() (or other appropriate
method for another IEventManager implementation).  These classes
provide all the other mechanics of event delivery from the server
to the subscribed clients.
<p>
The clients can use the methods in the IEventListener implementation
that is returned from IEventManager.register() to confine or
expand their subscription dynamically.
<p>
<b>Important Note:</b> This functionality does not provide any
guarentee of event delivery.  It is intended to be used for delivery
of events that will be informational in nature.  EventManager passes
a defauly highwater mark of 20 to limit queued events.  If the
thread delivering events out to the client
can not keep up with the outgoing rates, events will be
dropped to keep the VM from exploding in size due to queuing backups.
<p>
Its not possible to guarentee that all events will make it from one
VM to another without adding the overhead of transactions.  This
system was not designed to be used with transactional overhead.
Instead, it was designed for event traffic that sends the current
status of all data on a regular basis so that the current state of
that data will be visible to the subscribers.  Short lived event
status fluxuations should not be important in application using this
type of non-guarenteed event propigation.
