<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p align="left">The EOI Desktop environment provides access 
to a dynamic set of services that can be added and removed by your 
administrators.&nbsp; When you first start using the EOI Desktop environment, 
you will need to select the groups of services or tools that you want to have 
access to.&nbsp; Tools are grouped together by your administration to help you 
see new tools that are particular to your needs, as well as to limit the number 
of tools you need to sort through.</p>
<p align="center"><IMG src="../Images/topframe.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The image above shows the "My Groups" menu that shows the list of groups that are visible in the system and 
lets you select the ones you want to have active in your environment.&nbsp; Also visible in 
that image are the tabs, "My Apps", "More Apps", and "All Apps".&nbsp; The 
"My Apps" tab shows only the desktop.&nbsp; Items in the trees displayed 
in the "More Apps" and "All Apps" tabs can be dragged to and 
dropped on the desktop for quicker access as shown in the image below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The "My Groups" menu contains a menu item to 
manage the visible group names, and the list of active groups.&nbsp; The image 
below shows a sample "My Groups" menu.</p>
<p align="center"><IMG height=222 hspace=0 
src="../Images/topgroupsmenu.jpg" width=344 border=0></p>
<p align="left">The checked group names will be visible in 
the "More Apps" tree as shown in the image below.</p>
<p align="center"><IMG height=174 hspace=0 
src="../Images/moreappstree.jpg" width=348 border=0></p>
<p align="left">The applications that are in each group will 
be visible when the respective group folder is opened by selecting it.&nbsp; The 
"All Apps" tab tree will always show all of the selected groups so that you can 
easily browse the other groups to find tools that are useful to you.&nbsp; If 
there are disparate groups of tools that you are interested in, you can drag the 
respective icons from the trees onto the desktop as described above and access 
them that way, instead of through the trees.</p>
<p align="left">Finally. the "My Apps" labeled dropdown list 
provides instance access to all applications that are in your selected 
groups.&nbsp; This list can be quickly navigated to select tools as 
well.</p>
