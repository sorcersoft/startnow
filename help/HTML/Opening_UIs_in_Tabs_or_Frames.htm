<H1>Opening UIs in Tabs or Frames</H1>
<P>The EOI desktop environment will allow you to open UIs 
(which support this) in a tab, or in an external Frame.&nbsp; This can be 
convienent for UIs which have a significant size and thus can be used more 
easily when in a larger container. The "Options" menu has a sub-menu, "Default 
Open As" which shows the choices of how&nbsp;the default choice for where to 
open each&nbsp;UI can be selected.</P>

<P align=left>A desktop icon can be right clicked on for a popup menu to select 
how to open it.</P>

<P align=left>The "Open" selection or the "Open In Tab" selection can be 
used.&nbsp; Once the UI is opened, it is possible to "Detach" it into a separate 
frame and to later "Attach" it back to the "EOI Desktop" container.&nbsp; This 
functionality can provide some simple ways to manage using a large window for 
some operations, and then later reverting to a smaller&nbsp;window as 
needed.</P>
