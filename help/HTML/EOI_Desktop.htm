<H1>EOI Desktop</H1>
<P>The Cyte Technologies EOI Desktop provides a dynamic and 
configurable desktop environment for exploiting the dynamic nature of the Jini 
toolset and the Java platform.&nbsp; With the advent of more dynamic work 
environments and more focused work responsibilities, toolsets need to change 
more oftent to optimize the flow of work activities.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The EOI Desktop allows users to receive the lastest versions of the tools 
they are using instantaneously, thus removing deployment delays for bug fixes 
and critical new functionality.&nbsp; It also allows users to see new tools that 
are available for their use without having to manually install them, or 
otherwise know about them.</P>
